# *Snake Game*

A snake game is a classic game in which the player controls a snake that moves around a playing field or grid. The objective of the game is to eat food items that appear randomly on the screen, which causes the snake to grow longer.

+ ### Game Page
    The Game Screen is where all the action takes place. It provides the gameplay area where the player controls the snake to eat food and grow. It is the heart of the game, and the player spends most of their time here.

     ![Game Screen Page](documentation/snake-game-screen-min.png)

    - Elements of the Game Screen:
        
    
        1. Score Display:

             At the top of the Game Screen, there is a score box that keeps track of the player's current score. The score increases each time the snake successfully consumes a piece of food. Players aim to achieve higher scores with each playthrough.

             ![Score](documentation/snake-score-min.png)

        1. Play or Pause Control:

            This feature allows the player to manage the game. It provides three options:
            
            * Pause: When the player clicks the Pause icon, the game pauses, and the snake stops moving. This allows the player to take a break or assess the game situation.
            
            * Play (Hidden): Once the game is paused, the Pause icon is replaced with a Play icon. Clicking the Play icon resumes the game, and the snake continues its movement.

            * Stop: Clicking the Stop icon returns the player to the Game Over Screen.

            ![Play, Pause, Stop Controls ](documentation/play-or-pause-min.png)

        1. Game Grid:

            The Game Grid is a rectangular area where the snake and food are displayed. It is divided into squares, representing each cell on the grid. The snake and food move within this grid, and the player must navigate the snake across the cells to eat the food.

            ![Game Grid](documentation/snake-grid-min.png)

        1. On-Screen Controls:

            For players using desktop devices, the Game Screen provides on-screen controls in the form of arrow buttons. These arrow buttons (up, down, left, right) allow the player to change the snake's direction easily. Players can click these buttons to guide the snake around the grid.

            ![On-Screen Controls](documentation/snake-controls-min.png)

        1. Game Over Screen:

            Although the Game Over Screen is a separate element, it is an essential part of the Game Screen. When the game ends, whether due to the snake colliding with a barrier or itself, the Game Over Screen is triggered. It displays a modal window with a "Game Over!" message and the player's final score.

            ![Game Over Screen](documentation/snake-game-over-min.png)

+ ### Game Over Page

    The Game Over screen appears when the game ends (snake hits a barrier or itself).

    * The Game Over screen has the following elements:
        1. Modal window with a "Game Over!" message.
        2. Display of the player's score.
        3. Option to close the modal and return to the Menu screen.

## Future Features

###  Hammer JS Touch Controls 

* Unfortunately, due to the tight deadline, I was unable to  implement touch screen gestures with Hammer JS. Nevertheless, this functionality remains a top priority for the upcoming scheduled upgrade!

###  High Score

* A persistent display element would be added to the game screen, showcasing the user's all-time highest score. By having this prominently visible atop the current score, players would be continuously reminded of their peak performance, encouraging them to strive for better results.

### Bugs
+ ##### Solved bugs

    1. The game did not want to reset after playing the first time. 
        
        *Solution:* Add the ```function resetGame()```, as I forgot to write this code before. 
    ---
+ ##### Unsolved bugs
    - None.
+ ##### Mistakes
    - Mistakes were made while committing changes. I used past simple tense in commits due to the habit when I just started working on this project.
    - While progressing in my code I learned to use present simple tense in commits.
